# JS-Drum-Kit
This project is an interactive JavaScript Drum Kit, where users can play drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard. Each key corresponds to a unique drum sound, and visual feedback is provided for better interactivity.

The functionality includes:

Playing audio clips when corresponding keys are pressed.
Resetting audio playback for overlapping sounds.
Adding and removing visual effects during key presses using CSS transitions.
Notes:
This project was built by following a tutorial from Wes Bos, which explains the steps in detail.
The project serves as an excellent introduction to working with JavaScript events, audio elements, and DOM manipulation.
